# College
I attended the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in the capital city of Slovenia, Ljubljana.

In this repository there are reports from a few subjects where we had to present them digitally. Needless to say as an EE college we did an abundance of different subjects that I am unable to showcase in a Github enviroment. I do wish to however provide my coricullum to help clerify the scope of my knowledge. I would like to add that I attended the 2nd semester of my 3rd year of college in the city of Bucharest: Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology(ETTI) UPB and a few subjects in Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Robotics(FIR).

My Bachelors corriculum:
##First year:
-Mathematics I
-Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering I
-Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering II
-Mechanics and thermodynamics (Physic I)
-Atomics and optics (Physic II)
-Introduction to Computer Programming
-Microcontroller Programming
